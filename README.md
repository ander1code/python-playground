# 🐍 Python Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of code developed throughout my Python learning and training process. 📚 In it, you will find project implementations and exercises that cover everything from basic language concepts to more complex applications. 🔧

Additionally, I've included code examples using some of Python's main frameworks, such as:

- **Django** 🌐 (for web development)
- **Tkinter** 🖥️ (for building graphical user interfaces)

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! 🚀
